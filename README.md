# Ramadan Recipes

Ramadan Recipes website is my first project created to follow  [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) (Recipes project) from the foundations course. 

The purpose of Ramadan Recipes is to practice all of the HTML knowledge and setting up a GitHub Repository and to become familiar with Git basics. 

And lastly, to practice the process of writing a commit.






## Tech

The website was built with only HTML and no CSS. It consists of a main index page with recipes linked to it.
